The flexible exhaust goes into a Y pipe that feeds a Borla Hush catback from an STI. The flexible exhaust is only a temporary solution to drive the car N/A while I work on the turbo exhaust. The problem with the flexible pipe is that it loosens up over time, and I have had to reinforce it [like this.]( Totally ghetto, I know. Due to the \"looseness\" it rattles like a loose heat shield but only at certain rpms where it develops a resonance. It also seems to leak a bit. The rattle was god awful and embarrassing before I reinforced it but less noticeable now. With that said, it has a raspy/ tin can sound which I don't like, but I believe that is the flexible exhaust rattling. Otherwise it has a nice throaty rumble coming off idle up to 3500rpm and sounds like a race car from there up to 7000rpm.
