# Nissan-Customer-Review-Analytics-with-Transformer
This project is an application of Transformer on social media text mining.

## Question
The question behind this project: **what do people love about Nissan?** To answer this question, we analyzed what people are posting online through NLP TRansformers. In contrast to the traditional quant data analysis through surveys, we want to look at organic reviews, not generated by pushing the respondents through a 3-hour-long survey.
